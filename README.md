# penarth-pier-3d-model
A model of Penarth Pier in Blender with potential for surrounding land/seascape and buildings to be incorporated. Variations of the model representing different eras with appropriate structures/state of repair/decoration/associated buildings or fantasy variations would all be nice.

The most up to date full 'release' version of the model is contained in zip file '20200912 1041 penarth pier full set.zip'.

As of 18th April 2021 I have done some 'reading the manual' (of git and github) and will have hopefully improved my chances of keeping this repository up do with the most up to date versions of component files along with any new files which become part of the project.

The model is contained in a number of different files - the root file is pier.blend. This file contains links to other files in sub folders. At the time of writing the structure is:-
